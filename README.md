# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

This notebook impliments the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) project for Deep Learning (CS 6955) at the University of Utah. Essentially, a GAN consists of two neural networks, the generator and discriminator. The discriminator network is a traditional classifier, it takes an image and attempts to classify it as being real or fake. The generator takes random noise and transforms in into an image, the goal of the generator is to "ffol" the discriminator into classifying the generated images as real. Much more detailed explinations and results can be foud in the notebook.

NOTE: Only the code inbetween the "TODO" comments is written by me.
